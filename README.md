# SwiftParsing

##Starter Projects files:

+ TopApps.json: contains the JSON string to be parsed
+ AppModel: a plain old Swift object representing an app.
  + Goal: parse the JSON into a collection of these objects
+ DataManager: manages the data retrieval whether local or from the network.
  + Use methods in this file to load some JSON later into this tutorial
+ ViewController: empty view controller.
  + Add code here to request data from DataManager.swift and parse it in several different ways
